# Getting Started

## Important: Build Setup Required

After cloning this repository, please note that you will need to run `next build` before running `npm run dev`. This is because the `.next` directory is not included in the repository, and Next.js requires it to be built before running the development server.

## Setup Instructions

To get started, please run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
next build
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Install the dependencies
- Build the Next.js application
- Start the development server

You can then access the application at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).
